## Hi there 👋

<!--
**masterturtlefox/masterturtlefox** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on mostly school projects but looking to get started on my own side projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTMAL and CSS
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with everything but nothing specific. I'm open to all help.
- 💬 Ask me about why I'm here and just anything positive. 
- 📫 How to reach me: willliam.chandler@atlasschool.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love video games, I'm super into health and fitness, and I love positive people!
